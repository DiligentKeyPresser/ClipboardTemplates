Originally school project. There are two main use-cases:
- just paste static text to Outlook as template that is modified later in another program
- select some text, modify it and paste it back (done in one key-press)

The second usecase is very important for me presonally. I used it overy time I learn language. I use it for formatting flashcards in [Mnemosyne](http://mnemosyne-proj.org/) and [Repetitions](http://www.repetitionsapp.com/). And there is every second worth becuase you need piles of cards to learn language.

Usage is simple, program runs in try menu and if you:
a) press hotkey and it is pasted where your cursor stands
b) press hotkey, selected text is captured, placed in template and original selected text is than replaced by template megred with original selection (used e.g. for underline this text)


You can bind what ever hotkey you want to use.
