ClipboardTemplates
==================

Started as school project that should support templating using clipboard. Later I started using it as templating tool for formatting my flashcards in Mnemosyne and Repetitions.

Usage is simple:
a) press hotkey and it is pasted where your cursor stands
b) press hotkey selected text is captured, placed in template and original selected text is than replaced by template megred with original selection


TODO:  Can be used insted of clipboard
