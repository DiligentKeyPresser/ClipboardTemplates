ClipboardTemplates
==================

Started as school project that should support templating using clipboard. Later I started using it as templating tool for formatting my flashcards in Mnemosyne and Repetitions.

Usage is simple, program runs in try menu and if you:
a) press hotkey and it is pasted where your cursor stands
b) press hotkey, selected text is captured, placed in template and original selected text is than replaced by template megred with original selection (used e.g. for underline this text)


TODO:  Can be used insted of clipboard
